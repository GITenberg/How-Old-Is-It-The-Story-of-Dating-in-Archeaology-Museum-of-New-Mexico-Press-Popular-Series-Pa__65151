these methods are based.</p>
<p>Geochronologists tell us that there are two major types of
clocks: those that tick at an absolute rate of speed which can be
measured, and those which tick only once in a while. A clock of
the first type yields what is called an <i>absolute</i> date, revealing the
number of hours, days, years, centuries or millennia since an event
occurred. A clock of the second type yields what is called a <i>relative</i>
date, placing an event as before or after another event, but does
not tell us exactly how far they are apart in time nor how long ago
they occurred.</p>
<p>Depending upon how accurate his date must be to solve the
problem he has set for himself, the archaeologist will select absolute
or relative dating methods. Often, of course, the type of clock
he wishes to use is not available, and he must use the next best
type. Probably he will try to use a number of clocks of different
kinds on the problem since each clock will act as a check on the
others.</p>
<p>The absolute clock utilized most widely in archaeology is the
historical record. Men have used calendars for a long time, and
have often left records with written dates. On tombstones at a site
in old Virginia, on the pedestals of statues and other monuments
from classical Greece and Rome, on the walls of the tombs of
Egyptian kings, dates are clearly inscribed which can be related to
the sites dug into by the archaeologists. These dates must often be
recalculated in terms of the Christian calendar which we use. Most
calendars in use in the Mediterranean, the Near East and China
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
during classical antiquity have been successfully correlated with
the one we use today, and a date inscribed or noted on such sites
can be considered in our own terms. Other calendars, such as
those developed in the ancient cultures of the Maya on the Yucatan
Peninsula, have yet to be accurately correlated with our own.
Such calendars can be used on their own terms of course, and a
site which has an inscription in the Mayan calendar is known to
be so many years older or younger than another one with a different
date in that calendar. We speak of such a situation as a <i>floating
chronology</i>. That is, the sequence of events and the number of
years which separate them are known, but the dates of those events
in absolute time are unknown.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Tree rings afford another kind of absolute clock, the <i>dendrological</i>
method. Each year a tree adds a growth ring. Depending
on the amount of water the tree has available to it for cell growth,
the ring will be wider or narrower. Certain trees whose water requirements
are high live near streams or other places where their
roots can tap a constant supply of water. Such trees, referred to as
<i>complacent</i>, have annual rings which are all of about the same
width. Other <i>sensitive</i> trees live in places where they must depend
almost wholly on rainfall for their water supply, as on the slopes
of hills or in the clefts of rocks. Such trees have annual rings
which vary in width depending upon the amount of rain they receive.
In any given area, especially in arid and semiarid regions,
some years have more rainfall than others. The sensitive trees will
produce wider rings during years when there is more rainfall and
narrower rings in years when there is less. Often there are periods
of a decade or so when all of the sensitive trees will produce the
same pattern of ring growth; for example, three years of narrow
rings, one year of wide, two more of narrow and three more of
wide. Such a pattern is called a <i>signature</i>.</p>
<p>Signatures are the basis of tree ring chronologies. All the trees
in a region did not begin growing at the same time of course, but
every time there is a series of years which will produce a signature,
all the sensitive trees still alive will have that signature. Let
us say we cut down a sensitive tree in 1960 and, by counting back
the rings, find signatures at 1940-45, 1910-14, 1880-89, 1821-27,
1795-1800 and 1750-58. Next we recover a beam from an abandoned
Spanish Mission built in 1810. It happens to be from a
sensitive tree, and we can spot the 1795-1800 and the 1750-58
signatures near the outer rings. Now we have two records which
can be said to be <i>crossdated</i>. Let us assume that the Spanish Mission
log give us signatures as far back as 1350. An abandoned Indian
pueblo produces a log with signatures crossdating those of
the Spanish Mission log and continuing the record back to 1250.
Older and older archeological sites will yield older and older signatures
with each log crossdating some of the signatures of younger
logs.</p>
<p>At present we have a tree ring calendar for certain species of
trees extending back to about 100 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> This is called a <i>master
tree ring chronology</i>. A log from an archaeological site may contain
only one or two signatures and be, in itself, a floating chronology,
but by comparison with the master chronology one can
determine the cutting date. Having a series of cutting dates for the
construction timbers in an archaeological site yields the probable
dates at which the site was built and occupied.</p>

<p>Not all kinds of trees can be used for dendrochronology. Pine,
fir and pinyon are the most useful; juniper can sometimes be used.
Oak, cottonwood, willow and others are very difficult to date and
frequently cannot be used at all.</p>
<p>Another widely used absolute clock is that based upon the orderly
decomposition of carbon. This is the <i>radiocarbon</i> or C-14
method of dating. Molecules of various substances are made up of
atoms. We know now that not all atoms of a substance are precisely
the same. We speak of <i>isotopes</i> of an atom. To clarify this
let us think of the atoms of carbon as being made up of a mass of
ping-pong balls. Some atoms will have more ping-pong balls than
others, but all will have enough and in the proper order to be carbon
atoms. Each of the atoms with 14 ping-pong balls we shall
refer to as the carbon-14 isotope of carbon. There will be other isotopes
of carbon atoms too.</p>
<p>The carbon-14 isotope is about average in life span. It has been
determined that in any group of C-14 isotopes half of them will
lose two of their ping-pong balls and become C-12 isotopes in
5,730 years, plus or minus 40. This is known as the <i>half-life</i> of the
C-14 isotope. The &ldquo;plus or minus 40&rdquo; allows for laboratory error in
terms of years.</p>
<p>Now all living things contain carbon atoms, and some of those
atoms are C-14 isotopes. The amount of C-14 isotopes in a living
organism quickly reaches a stable percentage after which there is
no increase or decrease while the organism is alive. After it dies,
the C-14 supply is not replenished, and with the passing of 5,730
plus or minus 40 years, it has half the number of C-14 isotopes it
had when alive. In 11,460 plus or minus 80 years, it will have one
quarter as many as it had when alive.</p>
<p>The geochronologist takes a certain weight of carbon-bearing
matter from an organism which once lived. With simple chemistry
he can determine the number of carbon atoms in the material,
usually charcoal, wood, bone or shell. He places the material in a
chamber equipped with geiger counters and records the number of
C-14 isotopes converting to C-12 isotopes within a certain number
of hours or days. Since he knows how many carbon atoms there
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
are in the specimen, he knows how many C-14 isotopes there
would be if the specimen were alive. He also knows that as the
number of C-14 atoms decreases the number of clicks on the geiger
counter will decrease too. For example, if there are 2,000 C-14
isotopes, the decomposition of half of these over a period of approximately
5,730 years would register 1,000 clicks on the counter.
In the next 5,730 year period there would be 1,000 isotopes left,
and only 500 of them would decompose to register as geiger
counter clicks.</p>
<p>The geochronologist does the counting and analysis of the results
and sends the information back to the archaeologist in the
form of the number of years that have elapsed since the carbon
was part of a living creature; for example, 1,500 plus or minus 150
years BP (before present). The archaeologist, converting this to
the Christian calendar in 1964, would come up with <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 464
plus or minus 150 years. When was the sample actually alive? We
don&rsquo;t know exactly, but statistically we have a ninety-five percent
chance of being right if we say sometime between <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 164 and
764. This clock ticks in centuries. But the radiocarbon clock
doesn&rsquo;t tick very long, even in centuries, before running down. By
the time 30,000 to 40,000 years have gone by, the C-14 in any
sample is almost gone, and there is too little left to give enough
geiger counter clicks unless one is willing to wait a lifetime to record
two or three clicks.</p>
<p>The C-14 dating technique measures time by radioactive decomposition
of materials. There are other clocks which depend on
the chemical decomposition of materials. The forgery of the Piltdown
Man fossil was detected by a dating method which depends
on the decomposition of bone protein and its replacement by fluorine.
Fluorine is an element which occurs naturally as a gas, but
which combines readily with other elements to form compounds.
Some of these elements are common in bones. Since fluorine is one
of nature&rsquo;s most reactive elements, it tends to escape from the
compound it is in and to form other compounds. As the protein in
a bone decays, it is often replaced by fluorine. The amount of
fluorine in old bones, then, is expected to be more than in young
bones since it has had more time to accumulate. Since fluorine
does not accumulate at a constant rate, it affords only a relative
measure of age.</p>
<p>In the case of Piltdown, a group of bones was discovered at a
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
site, and was said to contain those of one individual who lived
about 60,000 years ago. Almost 100 years after they were discovered,
these bones were put to the fluorine test. It was found that
(1) some of the bones had less fluorine than others, so not all were
of the same antiquity and could not have belonged to the same individual,
(2) the younger bones had as much fluorine in them as
modern bones, and (3) the older bones had more fluorine in them
than bones known to be 60,000 years old.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" id="ncfig2" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="600" height="625" />
</div>
<p>Another form of absolute dating of importance to archaeology
is that called the <i>varve</i> method. This can only be utilized as an
absolute clock under very special circumstances however. Varves
are like tree rings in a way. In a lake which is sufficiently deep, or
at the edge of a glacier, particles of sediment are being deposited
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
continuously as a sort of fallout from the water. During the winter,
when the glacier freezes or the density of the water in the lake
increases because of the cooler temperature, less particles are deposited,
and those which are deposited are usually of a characteristic
color or texture. During the summer, when the glacier melts
or the lake warms up, more and different particles are deposited.
The bands of deposited sediment are called varves; every year two
varves are formed. Starting from the top, one can count back the
number of years in a varve series. If the top varve is of known date
such as the present year, one has a calendar with each varve having
a known date. Attempts are made to correlate one varve series
with another in order to recover even longer series. If the archaeologist
is lucky, and it is not rare in Europe, there will be materials
from a site buried in the local varve sequence. Counting back
gives an absolute age for the artifacts embedded in the site and
thus an approximate age for the site. The European varve chronology
is believed to extend back to about 9650 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p>
<p>Most of the clocks which the archaeologist uses to produce
relative dates, the before-or-after kind, have as their theoretical
basis the principle of <i>stratigraphy</i>. In effect the principle of stratigraphy
assumes two things: that the rocks of the earth are constantly
wearing down by erosion, and that things which appear to
be alike actually are alike and are probably more or less the same
age.</p>
<p>If rocks are constantly wearing down, it follows that the surface
of the ground is constantly building up. Thus the surface we
walk on is a younger, higher surface than that which our ancestors
walked on. When we dig below the surface, those things we find
which are at higher levels are younger than those which we find at
lower levels. The deeper we dig, the older things get.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the rate of deposition on the
surface is the same everywhere. If we dig two feet in one place we
may be at a level which is now five feet below the surface in another
location. If we find a particular object, say a type of pottery,
on the surface at site A and the same kind of pottery five feet below
the surface at site B, we can use the second of our assumptions
and maintain that both pieces are of the same age. Then any objects
found at higher levels than five feet at site B are younger
than the piece of pottery and are younger than anything found at
site A. This is the principle of stratigraphy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Like tree rings, objects in <i>stratigraphic sequence</i> can be crossdated.
These sequences may be of various kinds as any object will
do. Distinctive bands of sediment, distinctive artifacts, types of
fossils, specific details of chemistry or any other phenomenon may
be used with varying amounts of success. Suppose we have the
following sequences of objects at sites A and B:</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" id="ncfig3" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="777" height="1000" />
</div>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th>A </th><th>B</th></tr>
<tr><td class="c"><i>Black earth</i> </td><td class="c"><i>Brown dust</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"><i>Caliche</i> </td><td class="c"><i>Black earth</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"><i>Eroded layer</i> </td><td class="c"><i>Caliche</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"><i>Cobbles</i> </td><td class="c"><i>Yellow silt</i></td></tr>

<tr><td class="c"><i>Brown silt</i> </td><td class="c"><i>Eroded layer</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="c"> </td><td class="c"><i>Cobbles</i></td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Now there are some things that are similar about these two
<i>profiles</i> and other things that are different. Both profiles contain
layers of black earth, caliche, an eroded layer and cobbles. Both
profiles contain pottery, and both contain arrow points. The type
of pottery in profile A is the same as that in profile B, but in B
there is brown dust above the black earth. In profile B the brown
silt is above the eroded layer, while in A it is below the eroded
layer. In profile A the arrow points have different shapes than the
ones in profile B. What we need to correlate the sequences are
<i>horizon markers</i>, objects that are enough alike to be in the same
time range.</p>
<p>The pots in both cases look the same and are embedded in the
same kind of sediment, the black earth. They form one horizon.
The caliche may be a horizon marker, but this is not positive since
at profile A it is above the eroded layer, while at profile B it is
above the yellow silt. The eroded layer sits above cobbles at both
profiles, which makes the eroded layer-cobbles complex a pretty
good horizon marker. The brown silt is not a horizon marker because
it is above the eroded layer at one profile and below it at the
other. Furthermore, the arrow points which it contains are not all
of the same kind. The correlated sequence, using the horizon
markers, must be as shown in the accompanying <a href="#ncfig4">chart</a>.</p>
<p>The stratigraphy proves that the arrowheads in the upper
brown silt must be younger than those in the lower brown silt.
The next time we find arrowheads of the types recovered in the
upper brown silt we will know, regardless of the stratigraphic
sequence in the new locality, that they must be younger than the
types found in the lower brown silt, and they must also be older
than pottery of the type found in the black earth. We won&rsquo;t know
how many years old they are, but we have dated them in the sense
that we know they are older than some things and younger than
others.</p>
<p>The principle of stratigraphy is one of the archaeologist&rsquo;s most
useful theoretical tools as it allows one site to be compared with
others. Our example has shown how artifacts (pots and arrowheads
in this case) and sediment types can be placed in stratigraphic
order to provide a clock for archaeological dating. Other
objects which are commonly used as horizon markers in stratigraphic
sequences are fossils. Remains of extinct animals are often
used to prove extreme antiquity. Remains of plants and animals
will often indicate similarity of ecological conditions at two sites
and allow them to be crossdated.</p>

<p>The <i>geologic-climatic</i> method of dating combines the principle
of stratigraphy with an interpretation of the meaning of natural
occurrences. When geologists demonstrated that the earth had recently
gone through a period when enormous glaciers advanced
and retreated across the northern and southern hemispheres, they
began to speculate on the effects of such conditions on the landscape.
The surface would be scraped down to bare rock by the
advancing ice sheet. When the ice retreated, its load of rocks and
cobbles would tend to be left behind, while the smaller particles
of dirt would be flushed away in the rivers formed by the melting
ice. If the archaeologist found tools among the boulders and cobbles,
those tools should date to the period when the cobble and
boulder stratum was formed, the period when the glacier was retreating.
Here the geology gave clues to the climate, and if the age
of the climatic event was known, artifacts associated with the geology
could be dated.</p>
<p>It is through the geologic-climatic method of dating that archaeologists
discovered that human beings lived in southern Europe
at the margin of the last great glacier, and therefore the date
of their occupation was on the order of 20,000 years ago.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to use the geologic aspect of geologic-climatic
dating if one has other clues to the climate. Plant and animal fossils
are clues to ancient climates, since living organisms have a
tendency to live in climates to which they are best adapted. If we
find the fossil bones of a giraffe or an ostrich in the Sahara Desert,
we can conclude that at some time in the past the Sahara was not
a desert but a veldt, since giraffes and ostriches live in the veldt
today. If stratigraphy allows us to relate artifacts to those fossils,
we can maintain that the makers of those artifacts lived at the time
the veldt existed in what is now the Sahara area. Now if we can
relate the fossils to a date when such a climate could have obtained
in the area, we have a date for the artifacts.</p>
<p>Animal fossils are relatively rare, and fossil remains of plants
which can be seen with the naked eye are even rarer. But microscopic
pollen grains are not particularly rare in the stratigraphic
sequences of sediments, and are directly associated with artifacts in
many kinds of sediment. The pollen of most plants is protected by
a tough coat like that on many seeds. Millions of pollen grains are
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
produced by local vegetation each year, and a percentage of them
are buried in the yearly accumulation of sediment. Once they are
buried, the tough outer covering is preserved.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" id="ncfig5" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="600" height="608" />
</div>
<p>When pollen grains are extracted from their sediment matrix,
the different types of plants which grew in the area at the time the
sediment was laid down can be recognized from the distinctive
characteristics of their pollen grains. The <i>pollen analyst</i> has the
job of interpreting this information to discover the nature of the
vegetation patterns in the past and the climates associated with
them. Through dating those climates, the artifacts with which the
pollen sample was associated are dated.</p>
<p>Some archaeological sites do not allow dating by any of these
methods. The farmer plowing a field may pick up an arrowhead
and wonder how old it is. Can the archaeologist date the arrowhead?
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
The answer is a qualified yes. What the archaeologist will
try to do is give an educated guess as to the age of the arrowhead.
He might, for example, know that arrowheads of that type are
found at a site which is dated about <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1000 by various methods.
By correlation, he could apply that date.</p>
<p>If the arrowhead is not of a type which has been reliably dated,
the archaeologist may rely upon the method of dating known as
<i>seriation</i>. This method depends on the second assumption basic to
the principle of stratigraphy, that similar objects tend to be about
the same age. The farmer&rsquo;s arrowhead may not be exactly like any
which has ever been discovered, but it probably will be more like
some known ones than others. Observing the general style of the
arrowhead and the way in which it is made, the archaeologist can
make a pretty good estimate of when it was made.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the archaeologist goes into an unexplored
area where no absolute or relative dating techniques are available.
There he finds a number of sites with potsherds of types new to
archaeology. Can he date these sites? Again he uses seriation, but
this time he inverts the logical proposition. If things which look
alike tend to be of the same age, things which do not look alike
should tend to be of different ages.</p>
<p>His first task would be to separate all the different types of potsherds.
Taking a specimen of each type, he lays them out in a row.
If there is any difference in the sites through time, the styles of
pottery will change correspondingly. But there will be some styles
which change slowly and some which will influence others. For
example, if we were to seriate the style of automobile rear fenders
for the period 1956 to 1964, we would observe that they began to
sprout taller and taller fins; then the size of the fins became reduced
more and more. Some of the style aspects of pre-1956 rear
fenders went along with the development of fins and others
dropped out. Some of the style aspects which were developed with
the fins were retained after the fins decreased in size.</p>
<p>Seriation of the design styles on the potsherds will result in a
series of developments in style which are probably in chronological
order. Broad straight line designs may give way to mixed broad
and narrow straight lines, then to narrow straight lines, then to
narrow wavy lines. The archaeologist could then maintain that
sites which have potsherds with broad straight lines are separate in
time from those with sherds having narrow wavy lines. He won&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
know which is the older, because the sequence could work either
way. Stratigraphy or the cultural similarity between other artifacts
at the sites will probably resolve this problem.</p>
<p>The reader will now have realized that many of the clocks
used by archaeologists are interrelated. Relative dating clocks such
as stratigraphy, pollen dating and geologic-climatic dating are utilized
together where possible, and all are dependent upon the principle
of stratigraphy. Crossdating is thus of vital importance and is
constantly undertaken. The archaeologist tries to employ both
absolute and relative clocks to find out the age of a site. Stratigraphy
yields a series of relative dates for artifacts within the site;
geologic-climatic and pollen dating yield a series of dates for types
of sediment and samples collected in association with those artifacts;
tree ring dates yield the absolute age of the site which allows
the pollen, stratigraphic and geologic-climatic dates to be comprehended
in terms of absolute age. Radiocarbon dates act as a check
on the tree ring dates and, if they agree, lend support to the pollen
and geologic-climatic dates. The pollen and geologic-climatic dates
from the site are compared with similar dates from other sites as
additional checks. Since the clocks used by the archaeologist tick
at different rates of speed, and since not all of them are dating the
same thing, the archaeologist usually ends with a series of dates
for any given site.</p>
<p>New geochronological techniques are always being invented
and perfected. Here is a list of some that are expected to become
available in the next few years:</p>
<p>1. The <i>obsidian hydration</i> method. Obsidian, a naturally
formed glass, is so constituted chemically that it takes chemicals
from its environment at a slow rate. As it does so, the outside layer
changes from transparent to translucent or opaque. The depth of
the opaque layer, it is hoped, can be used as a measure of the
amount of time since the surface was exposed. As many artifacts
were made by chipping obsidian to form a sharp edge, this method
may reveal the time since an obsidian artifact was made.</p>
<p>2. The <i>thermoluminescence</i> method. The chemical properties
of certain minerals change when the minerals are heated to high
temperatures. If they are heated again they will glow, and the
amount of time they glow upon reheating depends on the amount
of time that has elapsed since they were heated originally. As yet
the rate has not been accurately calculated, nor is it yet understood
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
what effect different kinds of soils and atmospheres may have on
this rate. If the method is proven, it will be invaluable to archaeology
since it will afford a way of dating pottery directly on an absolute
time scale.</p>
<p>3. The <i>paleomagnetism</i> method. When an object containing
particles which can be magnetized is heated, the magnetic particles
line up according to the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. When the
object cools, the particles are trapped in this position. We know
that the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is changeable, and that at different
times it has been oriented in different directions. Work is now in
progress to determine how the field has varied through time and
how successfully one can date materials such as pottery or hearths
which were exposed to high temperatures in the past by the difference
between the present magnetic field and that trapped in the
object.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
